@Repository
public interface NoteRepository extends JpaRepository<NoteEntity, Long> {
}
// In this updated code, @Service annotation indicates that the AudioFileService is a Spring service component. The @Autowired annotation is used to inject an instance of the NoteRepository interface into the service class.

// The @Repository annotation is used to mark the NoteRepository interface as a Spring repository component. This interface extends the JpaRepository interface, which provides CRUD operations for the NoteEntity class.

// Note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may differ depending on the specific requirements of the Melody Master app.
